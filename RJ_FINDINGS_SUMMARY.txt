RJ 24-02-2026 AUDIT FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

AUDIT DATE:     February 24, 2026
AUDITOR:        Souleymane Camara
FILE:           Rj 24-02-2026.xls
STATUS:         CRITICAL BALANCING FAILURE - DO NOT SUBMIT

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE
================================================================================

1. QUASIMODO VARIANCE (Global Reconciliation)
   =========================================
   Cards + Cash Reconciled:        $81,413.25
   JOUR Daily Revenue + Tips:      $146,769.68
   VARIANCE:                       -$65,356.43 (CRITICAL)
   
   Interpretation: The JOUR tab shows 44% MORE revenue than what was actually
                   received in cards and cash. This is a RED FLAG for either:
                   - False GL postings in Lightspeed
                   - Unrecorded remittances
                   - Prepayments miscoded as revenue

2. CASH RECONCILIATION (RECAP)
   ==========================
   Physical Cash Shortage:         -$1,691.67 (moderate)
   Money Received:                 $25,542.43 (correctly includes reimbursements)
   DEPOSIT CDN:                    $23,251.79 (low - mostly cheques, not cash)
   
   Status: RECAP is internally consistent but has cash shortage

3. CARD SETTLEMENT VARIANCE
   ========================
   Transelect Total (NET):         $58,161.46
   GEAC Daily Revenue:             $51,519.10
   VARIANCE:                       +$6,642.36 (major)
   
   Interpretation: Transelect shows MORE than GEAC settled
                   Likely: Pending transactions or timing difference

4. AMEX TERMINAL MISMATCH
   ======================
   Transelect AMEX (NET):          $5,158.81
   GEAC AMEX Daily Revenue:        $4,717.02
   VARIANCE:                       +$441.79
   
   Interpretation: AMEX not settling properly or fees are being double-counted

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PRIMARY ISSUE: $65,356.43 MISSING FROM CASH/CARD RECONCILIATION

The JOUR tab reports:
  - Room Revenue:                 $53,962.39  (38% of daily total)
  - F&B Revenue:                  $60,009.01  (42% of daily total)
  - Other Revenues:               $27,249.50  (19% of daily total)
  - TOTAL:                        $141,220.90

But actual deposits show:
  - Card Settlements:             $58,161.46
  - Cash Deposits:                $23,251.79
  - TOTAL:                        $81,413.25

MISSING:                          $59,807.65 in unaccounted revenue

TOP SUSPECTS (in order of likelihood):

1. ROOMS REVENUE ($53,962.39) — Most likely culprit
   - This should appear in GEAC Guest Ledger, not daily cash
   - No card or cash settlement for this amount visible
   - Risk: Double-posted (once in GL, once in RJ)
   
2. F&B REVENUE ($60,009.01) — Second suspect
   - Only $7,541.89 appears in card settlements (Transelect)
   - Where is the other $52,467.12?
   - Risk: GL posted but not settled on terminals
   
3. OTHER REVENUES ($27,249.50) — Miscellaneous
   - Includes $25,194 in "Audio-Visual" revenue
   - Includes internet, massage, shop, etc.
   - Risk: Non-collected revenue (AR/prepayments) coded as daily revenue

4. PREVIOUS DAY ADJUSTMENTS
   - Could be Feb 23 transactions posted to Feb 24
   - Timing delay in settlement
   - Risk: Double-counting across days

================================================================================
FINANCIAL IMPACT
================================================================================

If $65,356 of this revenue is FALSE GL postings:
- Daily revenue would be only $75,864 instead of $141,221
- Cash position would show a $65k shortage
- Year-to-date revenue would be overstated by ~$65k
- Quasimodo variance would still not reconcile

If $65,356 is REAL but UNDEPOSITED:
- Cash is missing from the deposit
- Must be found in:
  * Outstanding cheques
  * Unposted AR invoices
  * Customer prepayments held
  * Petty cash accounts
- This requires immediate investigation

================================================================================
CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Complete before end of shift):
  1. [ ] Pull Lightspeed room revenue report for Feb 24
  2. [ ] Cross-check GEAC Guest Ledger balance movement
  3. [ ] Verify F&B sales by department in Lightspeed GL
  4. [ ] Pull payment processor settlement report for all cards
  5. [ ] Conduct physical cash count verification
  6. [ ] Get manager approval to hold RJ submission

WITHIN 24 HOURS:
  7. [ ] Reconcile POS terminal batches to Transelect
  8. [ ] Audit Audio-Visual revenue ($25,194 seems high)
  9. [ ] Verify Customer Deposits are not coded as revenue
  10. [ ] Review AR aging for any Feb 24 invoices
  11. [ ] Check for outstanding cheques not yet cleared

ESCALATION REQUIRED IF:
  - Room revenue is indeed $54k and separate from deposits
  - F&B revenue is GL-posted but not settled on terminals
  - Audio-Visual is a one-time large transaction
  - Any significant cash is unaccounted for
  - AMEX is settling through different processor

================================================================================
SUBMISSION RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

STATUS:         DO NOT SUBMIT THIS RJ

Why: The Quasimodo variance of -$65,356.43 is far outside acceptable limits.
     RJ policy requires variance within ±$0.01 of theoretical balance.
     This variance indicates either major GL errors or missing deposits.

What must be resolved first:
  ✓ Identify the source of the $65,356 discrepancy
  ✓ Obtain supporting documentation (GL reconciliation, settlement reports)
  ✓ Make corrections to the affected tabs
  ✓ Recalculate Quasimodo until variance is ±$0.01
  ✓ Obtain manager sign-off

Expected timeline: 2-3 hours if GL posting error, 1+ days if deposits missing

ANALYSIS: Transelect shows HIGHER card totals than GEAC settlement.
This is unusual and suggests:
a) Transelect includes pending transactions not yet settled
b) GEAC is missing some terminal batches
c) Timing issue: transactions captured but not yet settled
d) Multiple escompte calculations in Transelect overstating

TABLE 5: THE MISSING $65,356.43
================================================================================
This amount is NOT traceable to actual card/cash settlements:

LIKELY LOCATIONS (in order of probability):
================================================================================

1. ROOMS REVENUE OVERSTATEMENT
   Reported in Jour:               $53,962.39
   Status: Most likely culprit (38% of daily revenue)
   Risk: Double-entry with Guest Ledger, or prepayments miscoded
   Action: Cross-check GEAC Guest Ledger balance movements

2. F&B SALES INFLATION
   Reported in Jour:               $60,009.01
   vs. Transelect Restaurant/Banquet/Spesa: $7,541.89
   vs. Card + Cash:                $81,413.25
   Status: Very suspicious gap (F&B appears only in some sections)
   Risk: GL posted amounts don't match actual POS settlements
   Action: Reconcile Lightspeed GL to POS terminal batches

3. ADVANCE DEPOSITS / PREPAYMENTS
   Could be in "Other Revenues" ($27,249.50)
   Status: Not settlement revenue (customer's own money)
   Risk: Customer deposits coded as revenue
   Action: Check GL account codes for deposits vs revenue

4. INVOICE / AR REVENUE
   Direct billing without POS capture
   Status: Won't appear in card/cash reconciliation
   Risk: Mixing receivables with actual collected revenue
   Action: Review AR posting journal for February 24

5. PREVIOUS DAY RECONCILIATION
   Unmatched transactions from Feb 23 posted to Feb 24
   Status: Timing delay in settlement
   Risk: Revenue double-counted across days
   Action: Check transaction settlement dates vs posting dates
